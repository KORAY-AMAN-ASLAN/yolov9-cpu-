This script plots individual detections and predictions as distinct points, 
helping the reader distinguish between what has been measured (detections) and what is being predicted (future positions). 
The legend is placed outside the plot area so it doesn't obscure the data, 
and tight_layout() is called to ensure all elements of the plot are neatly arranged.
